<p>The jMock "Domain-Specific Embedded Language" API.</p>
<h3> Thread Safety </h3>
<p>
    jMock is thread safe in the most common use cases. That is,
    adding new expectations, printing the current state, and checking 
    method calls against the known expectations are all serialized and
    thread safe.
</p> <p>
    This means that the case where a background thread is 
    running and occasionally calling allowed methods while the 
    expectations for the next test are being set up is allowed and
    will not cause problems.
</p> <p>
    The Actions taken when a method call is matched are executed with 
    no locks held. Thus, Actions may take place in multiple threads 
    simultaneously.
</p> <p>
    States are synchronized. This means that a state 
    machine cannot change state WHILE expectations are being examined
    (but they can change during an Action).
</p> <p>
    Usage of Expectations, State, Sequences, and the like outside of
    the normal usage pattern is not guaranteed to be safe.
